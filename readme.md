# UNIX Network Programming

This repo is for learning UNIX network programming using C++. The code is based on W. Richard Stevens' book _Unix Network Programming_. It is an ongoing project and currently is for fun.

## Get started

If it is your first time cloning this repo, you need to obtain the git submodule which includes the book's source code. I modified it to suit the modern compilers. The easiest way to get started is to run the `build_unpv13e.sh` file to build the book's code and export its library. We will extensively use the book's header files and its predefined functions.

I hope to include the Python code to implement similar things to enhance the understanding of Unix Network, and all the Python code will live in `pynetwork` folder.
